Finding het groups...
Coloring atoms by element (green carbons in hets)...
Finding het groups (for Epik)...
Processing 0 het groups...
  Using Epik with pH: 7.4
        and pH Range: 0.0
  Max states per het: 32
  Epik was not run, as there are no preparable groups
Running ProtAssign...
  Uses -minimize option in ProtAssign
